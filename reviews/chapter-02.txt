Chapter 2

*C++ is an object-oriented programming language

*It comes from a previous language called C

*C was written in the 1970's to help build the Unix operating system

*Unix was one of the first portable operating systems that could run on any hardware

*C stays very close to the machine and required manual memory management

*C++ was developed in the 1980's as a superset of C, it is C but with object-oriented design

*C and C++ are compiled languages

*C++ is good for writing low-level system code because it is fast and can talk directly to the hardware


*Some examples where C/C++ shine:

1. Writing hardware drivers 
2. Writing for embedded devices (like CPU in appliances)
3. Writing physical and mathematical simulations modeling
4. Writing intense graphics processing
5. Videogames (Unreal Engine, Godot)



*Some examples where Python shines:

1. Server side scripts for managing a server or groups of servers
2. Scripting tasks in another utility such as a graphics program
3. Academic research (Python has extensive libraries)
4. Serving Web Pages (with Django)
5. Custom home side projects (like making a magic mirror)




Comments in C++ can be written using single line and multiline versions:

//A single line comment

/*
This is a
multi
line comment
*/


The hash symbol # initiates preprocessor directives, used in this class for including libraries

< > enclose a file name and sometimes a variable type when typecasting or calling advanced library functions called templates

( ) used to signify a function prototype, function header definition, or function call

{ } encloses a group of statements that execute as the result of an expression or mark the beginning and end of a definition

" " marks the beginning and end of a string literal

;   marks the end of a programming statement.





*cout is how we print to the screen in C++, contrasts with Python's print() function and C's printf() function

*cout is an object

endl and \n are two ways of printing new lines

\t prints a tab



int main() { return 0; } is the the main entry point to any C/C++ program.

*notice the return type int, the return value 0, and the empty parenthesis with nothing inside them

*all of our code executes inside main, even if it is written somewhere else
