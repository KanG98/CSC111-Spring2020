			<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>
				To compile a simple C++ program to learn the process of writing and running a program.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Materials </h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>C++ Compiler</li>
					<li> Access to your computer's terminal/command-line interface </li>
				</ol>
			</p>	
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Methods </h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li> Open the terminal for your operating system. </li>
					<li> 
						<p>
							Type:
						</p>
						<code>
							g++ --version
						</code>
						<p> And press ENTER. Make sure that you get a message displaying what version of g++ you have. If not you will need to install this program </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Create a new file named hello-world.cpp and open the file for editing in your favorite basic text editor or IDE.</p>
						<p> Place the following code inside the file: </p>
						<code>
							<pre>
#include &ltiostream&gt
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "Hello World!\n";
  return 0;
}
							</pre>
						</code>
						<p> When you are finished, save the file </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Next we are going to compile your human-readable code file into a computer program your computer can understand. In your terminal, navigate to the location of your hello-world.cpp file. Once there, type: </p>
						<code>
							g++ hello-world.cpp
						</code>
						<p> If you don't see any error messages, then congratulations! You have successfully compiled your first C++ program. The g++ command turns your human-readable text file into binary. Just to be sure, look inside the directory where your hello-world.cpp file is. You should see an additional file named a.out. This new file is the binary executable file that the computer will read to run your computer program. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Next, we are going to execute the binary file a.out. To do this, we simply need to type one more command. Please type:  </p>
						<code>
							./a.out
						</code>
						<p> You should see the words <output> Hello World! </output> print to the screen. If so, you have just completed the lab! </p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

					<h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<p>
				You now have a sense of the process for writing and compiling computer programs. You started by creating a file and filling it with code. Then you compiled the code into an executable. After this you ran the code and witnessed the output.
